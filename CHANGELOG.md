# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Local-only hardening

- Removed the old remote MCP tool and its API fetch path so MCP clients only
  receive local-index tools.
- Removed local query/access logging and the optional rerank trace writer;
  current builds do not persist search queries or file-open records.
- Removed release-binary publishing workflow material and kept `codedb update`
  disabled for source-build-only usage.
- Switched Zig package dependencies to vendored local paths and removed
  project-facing remote intelligence badges from the README.
- Hardened snapshot loading to reject unsafe or sensitive content paths before
  restoring any indexed state.
- The benchmark workflow no longer downloads Zig with `curl`; it now requires a
  preinstalled local Zig 0.16 toolchain.


## 0.2.5823 - 2026-05-29

`0.2.5823` is an MCP compatibility hotfix for direct `tools/call` requests.
It ships the issue #512 fix and adds a wire-level stdio backtest so future
releases catch this exact client-wrapper failure mode.

### MCP direct tool-call compatibility

- **#512 — direct calls no longer drop inline args when `arguments` is empty.**
  Some clients send canonical MCP `params.name` and `params.arguments`, but a
  wrapper layer may also emit `arguments: {}` while placing the real fields
  inline on `params`, for example `{"name":"codedb_outline","arguments":{},
  "path":"src/mcp.zig"}`. Direct `tools/call` previously treated the empty
  `arguments` object as authoritative, dispatched `codedb_outline` with no
  `path`, and returned `missing 'path'` / `received keys: []` even though the
  request contained a path.
- **Canonical MCP behavior is preserved.** Non-empty `params.arguments` remains
  authoritative. When `arguments` is empty or absent, direct calls now copy
  non-administrative inline fields into a clean argument map before dispatch.
  A legacy `params.args` object is accepted only as a compatibility fallback
  when canonical args are absent or empty. Malformed non-object `arguments`
  still returns the protocol error `arguments must be object`.
- **Diagnostics now match direct calls.** Missing-arg guidance no longer says
  "sub-op" for direct `tools/call`; it explains the canonical direct shape and
  separately mentions the bundled inline fallback.

### Backtesting

- Added `test "issue-512: direct tools call accepts inline args when arguments
  is empty"` to exercise the direct call handler.
- Extended `scripts/e2e_mcp_test.py` with Scenario 4, which sends the malformed
  direct stdio MCP request through the real server process. The fixed binary
  passes **20/20** E2E checks; the pre-fix binary fails Scenario 4 with the old
  `missing 'path'` / `received keys: []` response.
- A subagent also validated the change with codedb MCP available. Its MCP
  snapshot was stale, so it used codedb MCP to inspect what was available and
  then confirmed the current disk state plus the focused and stdio E2E tests.

### Release metadata

- `src/release_info.zig` and `build.zig.zon` are aligned on `0.2.5823`.

### Validation

- `zig build test -Dtest-filter=issue-512`
- `zig build test`
- `zig build`
- `python3 scripts/e2e_mcp_test.py --binary zig-out/bin/codedb --project /Users/blackfloofie/codedb-release-0.2.5823`
  — **20/20 passed**
- GitHub PR bench-regression for #513: **success**
- Historical release-asset workflow notes are no longer applicable after codedb
  moved to source-build-only distribution.

## 0.2.5822 - 2026-05-29

`0.2.5822` is a hot-path performance and release-reliability follow-up to
`0.2.5821`. It keeps the protocol fixes from `0.2.5821`, cuts the cost of
the common MCP tools, removes parser boilerplate, and fixes the remaining
Intel macOS/Rosetta release crash by leaving the x86_64 macOS artifact
unsigned until the Zig/Mach-O signing issue is resolved.

### MCP hot-path performance

- **Pre-rendered responses for hot tools.** `codedb_tree`, `codedb_outline`,
  `codedb_hot`, `codedb_deps`, `codedb_status`, and related MCP response paths
  now avoid unnecessary deep clones and intermediate buffers. The corrected
  benchmark harness now runs cases from the temp corpus root, so edit/read
  timings measure the intended project instead of the caller's checkout.
- **Lower edit latency.** `codedb_edit` avoids extra project-root work in the
  hot path and dropped from `236300 ns` to `44700 ns` p50 in the corrected
  microbench, an **81.08%** reduction.
- **No benchmark-critical regressions.** Comparing the corrected baseline to
  this release, every comparable MCP benchmark improved by more than 50%:
  `codedb_tree` `14530 -> 6270 ns`, `codedb_outline` `62930 -> 12820 ns`,
  `codedb_search` `33700 -> 8450 ns`, `codedb_deps` `1620 -> 70 ns`,
  `codedb_bundle` `93040 -> 28380 ns`, and `codedb_snapshot`
  `60100 -> 27750 ns`.

### Parser maintenance

- **`src/explore.zig` parser append cleanup.** Older language parsers had many
  repeated "dupe name/detail/import then append" blocks. These now route
  through shared helpers that preserve the prior symbol/detail behavior while
  cutting **393 net lines** from `src/explore.zig` (`83 insertions`,
  `476 deletions`). This is intentionally behavior-preserving cleanup after
  the parser expansion in earlier releases.

### Glob matching

- **#511 — brace alternatives in glob patterns.** `codedb_glob` and all MCP
  `path_glob` filters now support simple shell-style alternatives such as
  `**/*.{yaml,yml}` and `src/{mcp,explore}.zig`. Malformed braces without a
  comma continue to match literally, so existing literal-brace paths keep
  working. This fixes the confusing zero-result behavior agents hit when
  surveying YAML files with one glob.

### macOS Intel / Rosetta

- **#504 — signed x86_64 macOS binaries still crashed.** Local Rosetta testing
  reproduced the published `v0.2.5821` `codedb-darwin-x86_64` crash:
  `--help` exited `139` with no output. A fresh `0.2.5822` x86_64 build works
  when unsigned, but manually applying an ad-hoc signature to that exact binary
  brings back exit `139`. This matches the issue thread's native-Intel finding:
  the crash is triggered by codesigning Zig 0.16 x86_64-macos binaries on
  macOS 26, not by codedb startup logic.
- **Release workaround.** `build.zig` now makes `-Dcodesign-identity` opt-in and
  skips codesign for `x86_64-macos` even if the option is provided. The release
  workflow no longer passes `-Dcodesign-identity` for the Intel macOS matrix
  entry. Apple Silicon macOS artifacts still sign with hardened runtime when
  the signing identity is configured.
- **Docs updated to match distribution reality.** README and MCP docs now state
  that `codedb-darwin-x86_64` is temporarily unsigned and should be verified
  by SHA256 checksum. Zig version badges / requirements now say Zig 0.16.

### Release metadata

- `src/release_info.zig` and `build.zig.zon` are aligned on `0.2.5822`.

### Validation

- `zig build test`
- `zig build test-query -Dtest-filter="issue-511"`
- `zig build test-mcp -Doptimize=ReleaseFast`
- `zig build`
- `python3 scripts/e2e_mcp_test.py --binary zig-out/bin/codedb --project /Users/blackfloofie/codedb`
  — **17/17 passed**
- Rosetta x86_64 release test:
  - published signed `v0.2.5821` asset: `--help` exit `139`
  - patched unsigned `0.2.5822` x86_64 build: `--help` exit `0`,
    `--version` exit `0`, MCP e2e **17/17 passed**
  - manually re-signed patched x86_64 build: `--help` exit `139`
  - patched arm64 macOS build: signed and `--help` exit `0`
- Four-subagent SWE-bench Lite smoke using `codedb 0.2.5822` on non-temp
  workspaces:
  - `pallets__flask-4992`: target TOML config test passed.
  - `pytest-dev__pytest-5221`: two target fixture-listing tests passed with
    plugin autoload disabled for the old pytest checkout.
  - `sympy__sympy-12454`: rectangular matrix upper-triangular and Hessenberg
    target tests passed.
  - `psf__requests-2317`: codedb navigation succeeded, but the old checkout's
    target pytest collection is blocked on Python 3.14 because stdlib `cgi` was
    removed; a direct smoke confirmed byte and string methods normalize to
    `GET`.

## 0.2.5821 - 2026-05-28

Bundle of seven fixes from the open-issue triage on 2026-05-28.

### MCP server fixes

- **#502 + #503 — arg parser overhaul.** `codedb mcp <path>` no longer hangs forever in deferred mode (it now honors the path as root). `codedb mcp --help` prints usage instead of starting the server. Unknown post-`mcp` flags (e.g. `codedb mcp --snapshot`) are now rejected with a listed-valid-flags error. `codedb mcp` from a git-repo subdirectory walks up to the repo root. The deferred-scan path can no longer hang in `loading_snapshot` forever when the cwd isn't indexable — gives up after 13 s and unblocks `scan_done`.
- **#505 + #506 — MCP protocol version negotiation.** The server previously hardcoded `protocolVersion: "2025-06-18"`, which older Zed and certain opencode versions rejected with a startup timeout / "No MCP tools". Now echoes the client's version when it's one we've verified against (`2024-11-05`, `2025-03-26`, `2025-06-18`); for newer-than-known clients we return our latest known version.
- **#507 — search misses content after snapshot rebuild.** Files routed through `indexFileOutlineOnly` (snapshot load fallback, watcher incremental updates, WASM fast-path) were registered in `outlines` and `contents` but not in any search index. They were invisible to every search tier — including the tier-5 full-scan fallback, which short-circuited because the trigram index returned a non-null empty candidate set. Fixed by registering outline-only files in `skip_trigram_files` so tier 3 substring-scans them.
- **#508 — local fallback guidance.** The relevant local-index error paths now
  point users back to local search and snapshot workflows.

### Startup / platform

- **#504 — macOS Intel x64 segfault on bare `codedb`.** Bisected via Rosetta: Zig 0.16's runtime wrapper around `pub fn main(...) !void` crashes at startup on signed x86_64-macos binaries. The user saw `codedb` segfault before any output reached the terminal. Fix: `pub fn main(...) void` (infallible) + `mainTrampoline()` for the fallible work + a `handleFastPath` short-circuit for bare/`--version` invocations that writes via raw `std.c.write` and bypasses the worker-thread trampoline entirely. Also fixes a related "output silently lost on early exit" bug where `std.process.exit(_)` skipped the deferred `Out.flush()`; `Out.exitWithFlush` now handles the common usage / error-message exit paths.

### Distribution

- Historical remote distribution notes were removed after codedb became source-build only.


## 0.2.5813 - 2026-05-12

`0.2.5813` ships three structural improvements: a Tier 0 search-quality rewrite, a 4-6x faster regex matcher, and a bounded-memory content cache.

### Explore — search quality rewrite ([#448](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/448), [#449](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/449), [#450](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/450), [#451](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/451), [#447](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/447))

- **Tier 0 builds candidates directly from `word_index.search`**, deduplicating hits per path and sorting by code-first / hit-count-desc / posting-list-order. This restructure (a) keeps the code/doc diversity logic active for popular identifiers regardless of total posting-list length (#449), (b) surfaces canonical definition sites in large skip-trigram files (>64KB) without waiting for Tier 3 to fire (#447, #451), and (c) clamps prefix-tier expansion to `max_results` so the contract is honored (#450).
- **Rerank uses symmetric stem/query matching** so a query like `Explorer` now boosts `src/explore.zig` even though the stem `explore` doesn't textually contain `Explorer` (#448-a). Symbol-definition equality is now case-insensitive, matching the rest of `searchContent` (#448-b).
- **Regression test for #447** locks the new Tier 0 path against future refactors that might silently bury skip-trigram canonical files behind small-file hits.

### Regex — nanoregex integration ([#454](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/454))

- **Replaced the ~300-line homegrown backtracking matcher with [`justrach/nanoregex`](https://github.com/justrach/nanoregex)**, a pure-Zig Thompson-NFA/DFA engine with Python-`re`-compatible semantics. End-to-end in-process benchmarks on codedb's own ~1.2MB source tree show **2.7-4.3x speedup** on the common `codedb_search regex=true` shapes (literal, alternation, dot-star, char-class).
- **Correctness fixes** that previously failed silently:
  - `\b` and `\B` now work as word-boundary assertions instead of being treated as the escaped literal `b`/`B`. Patterns like `\bfn\b` now return matches.
  - `{n,m}` bounded quantifiers, lazy quantifiers (`*?`, `+?`), and the other PCRE-shaped features nanoregex supports.
  - ReDoS-safe: patterns like `(a+)+b` can no longer cause catastrophic backtracking.
- **Upstream patch:** while integrating, also fixed a false-negative in nanoregex's `extractLiteralPrefix` (patterns like `hel+o` computed prefix `helo` and silently missed `helllo`). Worth pushing upstream.

### Explore — bounded-memory content cache ([#208](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/208))

- **Replaced `Explorer.contents: StringHashMap` with a fixed-capacity CLOCK eviction cache** (`src/hot_cache.zig`). Pre-fix, file contents were all-or-nothing — either fully resident in RAM (1.7GB on openclaw) or entirely released by `releaseContents`. Now: 16384 slots with second-chance eviction, hot files stay cached, cold files fall through to disk read on next access.
- **Memory impact:** the `snapshot: writer streams` test (1002 files) drops MaxRSS from **623MB → 225MB** end-to-end. Cache state is bounded; eviction is exercised under pressure (5 inline `ContentCache` tests + the issue-208 integration test).
- Design adapted from [justrach/turbodb `src/hot_cache.zig`](https://github.com/justrach/turbodb/blob/main/src/hot_cache.zig) — CLOCK with probe limit 4, atomic hit/miss/eviction counters, zero dynamic allocation past init.


## 0.2.5812 - 2026-05-07

`0.2.5812` cleans up two papercuts surfaced during a v0.2.5811 verification run ([#445](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/445)).

### Explore ([#445](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/445))

- **`codedb_deps depends_on` no longer dupes multi-aliased imports.** A file aliasing the same dep across multiple `@import` sites (e.g. `const idx = @import("index.zig"); const Index = @import("index.zig").Foo;`) previously appeared once per `@import` in the forward edges — `src/main.zig` in this very repo showed `index.zig` 5x and `mcp.zig` 2x. `rebuildDepsFor` now dedupes via a `StringHashMap(void)` before calling `setDeps`. The reverse index (`getImportedBy`) was already correct.

### MCP

- **`codedb_find` description tightened.** The previous wording ("fuzzy file-name search") didn't make it explicit that it's filename-only — agents kept reaching for it on symbol-name lookups (e.g. `find rerank` expecting `src/explore.zig`). The new description says explicitly it is NOT content/symbol search and routes callers to `codedb_word`/`codedb_symbol`/`codedb_search` instead.


## 0.2.5811 - 2026-05-07

`0.2.5811` disables `codedb_bundle` advertisement by default ([#443](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/443)).

### MCP ([#443](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/443))

- **`codedb_bundle` is no longer advertised in `tools/list` by default.** Across multiple stages — empty-args schema (#434), `oneOf` augmentation (#437), OpenAI strict-mode regression (#440), and `codedb_projects` replay-loop (#441) — the bundle has remained a footgun for OpenAI clients (codex, forgecode, etc.) because the default schema can't bind sub-tool argument shape without `oneOf`, and `oneOf` is OpenAI-strict-incompatible. Disable the advertisement entirely until the schema can be reworked to bind args inline (no `arguments` wrapper). The dispatcher-side handler stays so any client with a cached schema doesn't crash on call. Set `CODEDB_BUNDLE_ENABLED=1` to re-advertise.
- **New helper `buildToolsListResponse(alloc, opts)`** centralizes the env-var-gated `tools/list` builder previously inlined in `run()`. `opts` are `{ bundle_enabled, discriminated_opt_in }`. Always returns an allocator-owned slice.

## 0.2.5810 - 2026-05-07

`0.2.5810` blocks `codedb_projects` from being a valid `codedb_bundle` sub-op ([#441](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/441)).

### MCP ([#441](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/441))

- **`codedb_bundle` rejects `codedb_projects` sub-ops.** `codedb_projects` lists every indexed project on the machine — a global directory enumeration unrelated to whatever repo the agent is actually working on. When a planner sees a previous bundle that called `codedb_projects`, it tends to replay the same shape (e.g. 5x `codedb_projects` in one batch), and recent-message attention bias amplifies it on continuation: graff and similar resumable clients ship the delta + `previous_response_id`, so the previous assistant message dominates the planner's context. Block it at the dispatcher, mirroring the existing rejections of `codedb_bundle` (recursive) and `codedb_edit` (write op). The `oneOf` discriminated schema (opt-in via `CODEDB_DISCRIMINATED_SCHEMA=1`) also drops the `codedb_projects` branch, so model output can't suggest it. Standalone calls to `codedb_projects` outside a bundle are unchanged.

## 0.2.5809 - 2026-05-07

`0.2.5809` is a hotfix for a v0.2.5808 regression: the discriminated `oneOf` on `codedb_bundle` ops items (Stage 2 of [#437](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/437)) breaks every MCP client backed by the OpenAI Responses API (codex, forgecode, etc.). OpenAI's strict-mode tool-schema validator rejects `oneOf` outright with `Invalid schema for function 'mcp_codedb_tool_codedb_bundle': 'oneOf' is not permitted`, which makes the entire `codedb_bundle` tool unusable on those clients.

### MCP

- **`oneOf` is now opt-in via `CODEDB_DISCRIMINATED_SCHEMA=1`.** By default, `tools/list` serves the raw schema with only Stage 1's `required: ["tool", "arguments"]` (from [#434](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/434)) — works on every MCP client. Anthropic-backed clients that benefit from the discriminated `oneOf` can re-enable it by setting the env var on the codedb process. The `buildAugmentedToolsList` builder is unchanged; only the call site in `mcp.zig` is gated on the env var. The `#424` runtime inline-args fallback continues to handle non-conformant clients.

### Compatibility

- v0.2.5808 set the bundle schema to a structure OpenAI's validator rejects. If you upgraded yesterday and saw `tools[N].parameters` errors from codex/forgecode, this is the fix — no opt-in needed.
- Anthropic-backed clients (Claude Code, etc.) that want the stronger constraint: `export CODEDB_DISCRIMINATED_SCHEMA=1` before launching the MCP server.

## 0.2.5808 - 2026-05-06

`0.2.5808` is a tool-schema fix for `codedb_bundle` plus historical offline ranking instrumentation that has since been removed. Three PRs ship together: [#435](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/pull/435) (Stage 1 of [#434](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/434)), [#438](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/pull/438) (Stage 2 of [#437](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/437)), and [#436](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/pull/436).

### MCP ([#434](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/434), [#437](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/437))

Function-calling LLMs were emitting `{tool: "codedb_outline", arguments: {}}` and similar payloads that then failed each sub-op with `received keys: [tool, arguments]`. The schema permitted the empty payload and the model picked the minimum-valid one. Fixed in two stages, both shipping here.

- **Stage 1: `arguments` is now required on bundle ops items.** Pre-fix the items schema was `required: ["tool"]` with `arguments` as a bare `{type: "object"}`, so `arguments: {}` and outright omission were both valid input. Schema-greedy function-calling models read this as authoritative and emitted the empty form, which then misrouted through the inline-args fallback at `mcp.zig:1948` and surfaced as `received keys: [tool, arguments]` from each sub-tool. Adding `"arguments"` to `items.required` forces the model to populate the wrapper. The `#424` runtime inline-args fallback stays as a backstop for non-conformant clients.
- **Stage 2: discriminated `oneOf` over `tool`.** Stage 1 forces presence but not contents — a schema-greedy model could still satisfy `required: ["tool", "arguments"]` by emitting `{tool: "...", arguments: {}}`. Stage 2 binds the *contents* of `arguments` to each sub-tool's actual `inputSchema` via a discriminated `oneOf` with one branch per dispatchable codedb_* sub-tool. Each branch pins `tool` to a `const` (e.g. `"codedb_outline"`) and `arguments` to that sub-tool's schema (with its own `required` array preserved), so once a model picks a sub-tool the only matching branch tells it exactly which keys to populate. `codedb_bundle` (recursive) and `codedb_edit` (write op) are excluded since `handleBundle` rejects them at runtime. The augmented schema is built once at server startup from the per-sub-tool schemas already advertised in `tools_list` — no hand-maintained duplication. Falls back to the raw `tools_list` if augmentation fails.

### Search ([#436](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/pull/436))

- **`rerankAndFinalize`: score-then-sort, even at len 1.** A pre-existing micro-optimization skipped multi-signal scoring when the result list had fewer than two entries. Scoring now always runs; only the sort is guarded behind `len > 1`. Cost is a few us per single-result search.

### Validation

- Two failing tests in `src/tests.zig` (`issue-434`, `issue-437`), each one fails on `main` without its respective stage and passes with it. End-to-end Sonnet 4.6 test against the new bundle schema: prior bug (empty `arguments` payloads under no fix; wrong-keyname payloads under Stage 1 only) does not reproduce. Same task that previously emitted `codedb_word` with `{"query": "..."}` (failing) now emits `{"word": "..."}` (succeeding) — the discriminated branch's `required: ["word"]` constraint flows through to model output.
- Bundle schema payload size doubled (~12KB → ~24KB) due to inlining 19 sub-tool schemas as `oneOf` branches. Acceptable cost for the constraint.
- 513/513 tests pass on the merged release branch.

## 0.2.5807 - 2026-05-06

`0.2.5807` is a search-quality + crash-fix release covering six issues. The headline is a multi-signal reranker for `searchContent` plus a P0 crash fix in `searchInContent`. All six fixes ship in a single bundle ([#425](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/425), [#426](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/426), [#427](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/427), [#429](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/429), [#430](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/430), [#431](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/431)).

### Reliability ([#431](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/431))

- **`searchInContent`: bounds-check fixes a P0 crash.** When the query was longer than any indexed file's content, `content.len - query.len + 1` underflowed `usize` and the binary aborted with integer-overflow panic (Debug) or SIGBUS (ReleaseFast). One-line guard at the top of `searchInContent` returns early when `query.len > content.len`. Reachable from any user-supplied query that exceeded the smallest indexed file (e.g. a one-byte stub). Fixed.

### Search quality ([#425](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/425), [#426](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/426))

- **`codedb_callers`: whole-word match.** `handleCallers` previously substring-matched the symbol name across the index and only excluded the canonical definition line of the searched name itself. Searching for `fooBar` returned matches inside `fooBarExtended` — both its definition site and any references — as if they were call sites. A new `hasWholeWordMatch` check gates every emitted result on identifier-boundary characters on both sides of the hit.
- **`codedb_callers`: language gate.** `handleCallers` fed `searchContentWithScope` across every indexed file regardless of language, so markdown design docs and other prose surfaced as call sites whenever the symbol name was mentioned. A new `langHasCallSites` predicate excludes data formats (`json`, `yaml`), markup/styling (`markdown`, `css`, `scss`), declarative schemas (`protobuf`), and unknown files.

### Search ranking ([#427](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/427), [#429](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/429), [#430](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/430))

- **Tier 1 candidate sort by per-file word-hit count.** `searchContent`'s Tier 1 sorted trigram candidates by content length ascending and then capped per-file at `max(1, max_results / estimated_total)`. When small unrelated files dominated the candidate list, they each contributed one hit and saturated the result quota before the larger definition-dense file was scanned. Now Tier 1 ranks candidates by per-file word-index hit count (desc) with content length (asc) as a stable tiebreaker — the file with the most occurrences scans first.
- **Tier 0 processes code before docs.** With `max_results=50` and the per-file cap of 10, five markdown files mentioning the query 10+ times each could collectively saturate the quota before the canonical source file was reached, leaving the source file completely absent from results. A new `isDocLanguage(Language)` predicate gates a two-pass loop: code-language hits first, doc-language hits second. Same per-file cap, same dedup, same early-return — only iteration order changes. Source files now win the recall race.
- **Multi-signal rerank.** The post-pass rerank counted per-line query occurrences only and broke ties on path-asc + line-asc, which buried symbol-definition lines under alphabetically-earlier comment mentions, ranked `examples/foo.zig` above `src/foo.zig`, and lost basename-match intent entirely. New `rerankSignalScore` composes per-line occurrence count, a symbol-definition boost (+5 when the hit line is a defined symbol whose name matches the query, looked up via outlines), a basename-match boost (+15 exact stem, +8 substring, case-insensitive), a path-segment match boost (+6 for queries like `parser` matching `src/parser/foo.zig`), and a path-prior penalty (×0.6 for `tests/`, `examples/`; ×0.4 for `vendor/`, `node_modules/`, `third_party/`). Constants are tuned so a 5x-higher per-line frequency still wins on its own, while each signal individually flips alphabetic ties.
- **Rerank applies on every return path.** Pre-fix the multi-signal rerank only ran on fall-through to the final return; Tier 0 and Tier 1 early-returns at `max_results` bypassed it entirely. Lifting the rerank into a `rerankAndFinalize` helper called from every searchContent return point gives the symbol-def / basename / path-prior signals consistent coverage regardless of which tier filled the quota.
- **Doc-language penalty in rerank.** Live-binary testing showed CHANGELOG and benchmark `.md` files with 4-6 mentions of an identifier on one line outranking actual code call sites under per-line frequency. The reranker now caps doc-language scores at 1.0 then halves them, so any code hit (`score >= 1`) outranks any markdown / json / yaml / unknown-language hit. Symmetric with the path-prior penalty.

### Validation

- 271 lines of regression tests in `src/tests.zig` — one or more per issue, all failing on `main` without the fix and passing with it. Bundle-level Sonnet 4.6 validation (real codebase, side-by-side comparison vs. the 0.2.5806 baseline) shows definition sites promoted to #1 for `handleCallers`, `pathHasSegment`, `BenchContext`, `Explorer`; `src/explore.zig` now ranks #1 for the `searchContent` query (was completely absent from baseline top-5); `src/watcher.zig` at #1 for `watcher`; no quality regressions on innocent queries; RSS delta under 1%.

## 0.2.5795 - 2026-05-04

`0.2.5795` closes out [#356](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/356) with phase 3 — three small ergonomics polishes that complete the rewritten reliability scope — plus a privacy/disk-leak fix for [#367](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/367).

### Reliability ([#356](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/356) phase 3)

- **`codedb_outline`: stale-index recovery hint.** When a path isn't indexed, the response already gets fuzzy suggestions (phase 1). It now also includes `hint: try codedb_index if the file was added recently` so agents know how to recover from a freshly-added file the watcher hasn't seen yet — no more relying on tribal knowledge of the operator command.
- **`codedb_read`: fuzzy path fallback on read failure.** `codedb_outline` already surfaces `did you mean:` suggestions when its path doesn't index; `codedb_read` now does the same when its disk read fails. A mistyped path is recoverable in one shot without a separate `codedb_find` round-trip.
- **`codedb_query`: per-stage summary tail.** Successful pipelines now emit a structured `--- stages ---` block listing each step's op and outgoing file count. Long pipelines become legible at a glance without parsing the unstructured per-step output above it.

### Storage ([#367](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/367))

- **`data.log`: truncate on open.** Previously, `Store.openDataLog` opened the file with `truncate=false` and seeded the write cursor to the existing length, while `Store.init` returned an empty in-memory index and nothing replayed the log on load. Net effect: every prior session's raw `codedb_edit` content (potentially including secrets/PII pasted into a `content` arg) accumulated forever as unreachable orphan bytes in a file that looks like a log but isn't read by anyone. The log is now truncated on every process start, since the in-memory index is always empty at that point and the on-disk bytes are unreachable.

### DX

- **TTY summary surfaces received-keys diagnostic.** The `received keys: [...]` hint from #356 phase 1+2 only landed in `content[1]` of the MCP envelope, but many clients only render `content[0]` (the colored single-line summary). Missing-arg errors now append a compact `(received: [...])` tail to the summary too, so the diagnostic is visible regardless of how many blocks the client renders.

With this release, [#356](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/356) is closed:
- ✅ Phase 1 — pipeline partial results, outline fuzzy fallback, query received-keys diagnostic (0.2.5793)
- ✅ Phase 2 — received-keys diagnostic across all single-tool handlers (0.2.5794)
- ✅ Phase 3 — stale-index hint, read fuzzy fallback, query per-stage summary (0.2.5795)

## 0.2.5794 - 2026-05-04

`0.2.5794` extends [#356](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/356) phase 2 — the `received keys: [...]` diagnostic now lands on every single-tool handler with a required argument. Tiny release; entirely an ergonomics polish on top of `0.2.5793`.

### Reliability ([#356](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/356) phase 2)

The `received keys: [...]` self-diagnose hint is now wired into:

- `codedb_outline` — missing `'path'`
- `codedb_symbol` — missing `'name'`
- `codedb_search` — missing `'query'`
- `codedb_word` — missing `'word'`
- `codedb_deps` — missing `'path'`
- `codedb_read` — missing `'path'`

Combined with phase 1 (`codedb_query` pipeline steps and `codedb_bundle` ops), every read-path tool now surfaces the keys it actually received when a required argument is missing. Callers can self-diagnose typos like `file_path` vs `path` without retrying blind. `codedb_edit` deliberately keeps the bare error — write operations should fail loudly without hinting at alternatives.

## 0.2.5793 - 2026-05-04

`0.2.5793` is a search recall, ranking, and reliability release on top of `0.2.5792`. All three items from [#363](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/363) plus phase 1 of [#356](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/356) are resolved.

### Search and ranking ([#363](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/363))

- **`codedb_search` recall: source-file matches no longer dropped when doc files dominate the word index.** A Sonnet 4.6 sub-agent driving the live MCP reproduced [#363](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/363) item a: querying `searchContent` against this repo returned doc files (CHANGELOG.md, architecture.md, etc.) but missed `src/explore.zig` itself. Root cause: Tier 0 of `searchContent` (`explore.zig:1511`) iterates word-index hits in posting-list order and saturates the result quota with hits from heavily-mentioning files before reaching source files indexed later. Fix: per-file cap of `max(1, max_results / 5)` in Tier 0 so a single hot file can't crowd out the rest. Closes [#363](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/363) (item a).
- **Fuzzy find: exact basename match now dominates ranking.** Querying `cli.rs` against a multi-crate workspace previously returned four unrelated `lib.rs` files ahead of the actual `crates/forge_main/src/cli.rs`. The compounding factors were the special-entry-point bonus (which gave `lib.rs` / `main.go` / `index.ts` a +5% boost regardless of query) and path-length normalization rewarding shorter parent paths. Fix: when the query case-insensitively equals the filename, apply a 4× multiplier — fzf-style "exact match always wins." Closes [#363](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/363) (item b).

### Query reliability and ergonomics ([#356](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/356) phase 1)

The "Agent Context Planner" framing was dropped — codedb stays a tool, agents stay in charge of composition. Three small reliability improvements land:

- **`codedb_query`: partial results when a step fails.** The pipeline previously bailed on the first error and discarded successful prior-step output. Now the prior-step output is preserved and a structured `--- partial ---` tail names the failing step + reason. Agents can recover from a single bad step instead of starting over.
- **`codedb_outline`: fuzzy path fallback.** A non-indexed path used to return a bare `error: file not indexed`. Now appends up to 3 fuzzy-matched indexed paths under a `did you mean:` header, so an agent that mistypes can self-correct without a separate `codedb_find` round-trip.
- **`codedb_query`: received-keys diagnostic on missing-arg errors.** Mirrors the [#357](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/357) `codedb_bundle` diagnostic. When a step fails with `error: search needs 'query'` but the step actually has a `q` key instead, callers see `received keys: [op, q]` so they can tell whether codedb dropped the field or the client sent it under the wrong name. Wired through `op`-detection plus `find`, `search`, `word`, and `symbol` step error paths.

### Cosmetic

- **`codedb --version` and `codedb_status` now report the correct version.** The `0.2.5792` release shipped with `src/release_info.zig` at `"0.2.579"` while `build.zig.zon` was at `"0.2.5792"` — so binaries built from that source tree self-reported as the older version. Both are now synced to `0.2.5793`.

### Carried over from 0.2.5792

The `received keys: [...]` diagnostic that landed in [#357](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/357) (PR [#362](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/pull/362), shipped in 0.2.5792) addresses [#363](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/363) item c — bundled-op argument errors now surface the keys actually received so callers can self-diagnose.

## 0.2.5792 - 2026-05-04

`0.2.5792` is a tools, safety, and performance release. Two new MCP tools land (`codedb_glob`, `codedb_ls`), `codedb_edit` gains a `dry_run` preview and an `if_hash` stale-line guard, and the `**` glob matcher is rewritten to fix a recall regression and pick up a 30% p50 win on common patterns.

### Highlights

- **New: `codedb_glob` and `codedb_ls` MCP tools.** Native glob and directory listing surfaced to MCP clients alongside the existing search/outline tools. Closes [#359](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/359).
- **`codedb_edit` is now safer.** `if_hash` is enforced — edits against stale lines fail fast instead of silently overwriting. `dry_run` returns the would-be diff (and a corrected `inserted_count`) without writing. Closes [#360](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/360).
- **Glob `**` correctness fix.** The pipeline filter previously used `mcp.globMatch`, which dropped matches when `**` had to backtrack across directory depths. Replaced with `explore.matchGlob`. A retrieval-recall regression test now pins behavior across all six retrieval surfaces (full-text, word index, symbol index, fuzzy path, glob, dep graph). Closes [#359](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/359).
- **30% faster `**/*.md` glob.** `matchGlob` short-circuits common patterns: `**/*X` degenerates to `endsWith`, and patterns with long literal prefixes that the path can't match exit early. Measured 540 µs → 377 µs p50.

### Correctness: Edit

- `if_hash` mismatch returns an error instead of writing — no more silent stale-line overwrites. (#360)
- `dry_run` mode returns the planned diff without touching the file; `inserted_count` reports the correct line count. (#360)
- `codedb_edit` response is now hex-consistent with `codedb_read` so callers don't have to normalize hash formats.

### Correctness: Glob

- Pipeline glob filter routes through `explore.matchGlob`, fixing `**` backtracking across directory depths. (#359)
- Recall regression test plants a flat 5-file corpus (definition, importer, test, decoy, prose) and asserts every retrieval surface — `searchContent`, `searchWord`, `findAllSymbols`, `fuzzyFindFiles`, `globPaths`, `getImportedBy` — returns the expected files and excludes the decoy. Fires if any index silently drops a file in the future.

### Performance

- `matchGlob` fast paths for `**/*X` (endsWith) and long literal prefixes. −30% p50 on `**/*.md` (540 → 377 µs).
- `lsDir` / `globPaths` allocation trims: pre-reserved result-list capacity, removed the redundant `seen_files` map in `lsDir`. Effect on a 113-file repo is within run-to-run noise; kept because it removes dead work and reduces allocations on larger repos.

### Issues Closed

- [#359](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/359) — Tool suggestions: native `glob` and `ls` tools
- [#360](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/360) — `codedb_edit` suggestions (`if_hash` + `dry_run`)

## 0.2.57 - 2026-04-13

`0.2.57` is a broad correctness, performance, and reliability release. It ships everything merged to main since `0.2.56` plus nine index and watcher bug fixes.

### Highlights

- **10× faster initial indexing.** Worker-local parallel scan with deterministic merge: each scan worker builds its own partial `Explorer`, then the results are merged on the main thread with no lock contention during the hot path. Closes [#221](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/pull/221).
- **Full `codedb nuke` uninstall.** `nuke` now removes all codedb data, kills any running daemon, deregisters MCP entries from Claude / VS Code / Cursor configs, and cleans up the install binary. Closes [#239](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/pull/239).
- **MCP: 10-minute idle timeout + dead-client detection.** Sessions that go quiet for 10 minutes are reaped automatically; POLLHUP on stdin is detected immediately so zombie MCP processes don't accumulate. Closes [#148](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/148).
- **TrigramIndex id_to_path is now bounded.** A free-list of released doc_id slots is reused on re-index, so `id_to_path` grows only to the peak number of simultaneously live files, not total files ever indexed. Closes [#247](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/247), [#227](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/227).
- **watcher: git HEAD check is mtime-gated.** `.git/HEAD` mtime is statted per poll; `git rev-parse HEAD` forks only when it changes. Reduces steady-state background subprocesses from ~30/min to ~0 on idle repos. Closes [#254](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/254).
- **Rosetta 2 / Apple Silicon stack fix.** Release builds now use an 8 MB stack on macOS, fixing stack-overflow crashes under Rosetta translation. Closes [#223](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/223).

### Performance And Memory

- Worker-local initial indexing: each thread maintains its own `Explorer` during scan, eliminating the cross-thread merge bottleneck. Merge is deterministic so snapshot replay is reproducible. (#221)
- Steady-state watcher: mtime guard on `.git/HEAD` eliminates per-cycle fork+exec, saving CPU on large repos. (#254)
- `searchContent` fallback now iterates only the `skip_trigram_files` set (files indexed past the 15k cap) instead of all outlines. (#250)
- `EventQueue.head/tail` and `Store.seq` converted from atomic values to plain integers — all access already holds the owning mutex. Removes unnecessary memory fence instructions.

### Correctness: Index And Explorer

- `TrigramIndex.removeFile`: `path_to_id.remove` is now the first operation, fixing a ghost-entry bug where files missing from `file_trigrams` left stale map entries. (#246)
- `TrigramIndex.getOrCreateDocId`: reuses freed doc_id slots from `free_ids: ArrayList(u32)`, keeping `id_to_path` bounded. (#247, #227)
- `PostingList.removeDocId`: O(log n) binary search replacing the previous O(n) linear scan.
- `AnyTrigramIndex` mmap_overlay: `candidates` / `candidatesRegex` now `deinit` the result ArrayList on the error path, closing an OOM buffer leak. (#251)
- `commitParsedFileOwnedOutline`: errdefer rolls back `word_index.indexFile` if the subsequent trigram index step fails, keeping word and trigram indexes in sync. (#252)
- `searchContent` fallback restricted to `skip_trigram_files` set, reducing false-negative range from O(all files) to O(skip-trigram files). (#250)

### Correctness: Nuke And Config

- `rewriteConfigFile`: writes to `{path}.tmp`, syncs, then renames — no more truncated config files on kill. (#249)
- `nuke` now deregisters MCP server entries from JSON configs (Claude, VS Code), TOML configs (Cursor), and removes the install binary. Handles corrupted or non-standard config files gracefully. (#239)

### Correctness: Snapshot

- `readSectionBytes` opens the snapshot file once; extracted `readSectionsFromFile` helper shared with `readSections`. (#253)
- `readSectionString` limit raised from 4,096 to `std.math.maxInt(u16)` — long symbol names no longer return errors.
- `loadSnapshotFast` treats a corrupt `OUTLINE_STATE` section as an empty map rather than aborting startup.

### MCP Stability

- 10-minute idle timeout: MCP sessions that stop receiving input are reaped, preventing zombie processes on long-running Claude sessions. (#148)
- POLLHUP detection: stdin is polled; a closed read-end triggers immediate clean shutdown instead of waiting for the next read timeout. (#148)
- `codedb_status` memory and index diagnostics are unaffected by call-count races. (#179)

### Infrastructure

- 8 MB release stack on macOS prevents stack overflows under Rosetta 2 on `aarch64` binaries running via translation. (#223)
- `help` command now compiles and exits correctly as a standalone CLI invocation. (#238)
- `approxIndexSizeBytes` updated for the `AnyTrigramIndex` union layout. (#236)

## 0.2.56 - 2026-04-09

`0.2.56` was a distribution hotfix from the pre-source-build-only era. The remote installer and self-update details are no longer applicable.

## 0.2.55 - 2026-04-09

`0.2.55` is a performance and reliability release focused on warm reopen, MCP startup behavior, search quality, parser correctness, and installer safety. The headline change is that warm CLI and MCP project loads now reopen persisted state directly instead of spending seconds rebuilding heap indexes.

### Highlights

- Warm snapshot reopen now restores snapshot outline/state directly, reuses persisted trigram sidecars, and avoids redundant `word.index` rewrites. This closes [#220](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/220).
- `codedb_query` adds a composable MCP search pipeline so agents can do multi-step retrieval in one tool call. This closes [#168](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/168).
- Historical query-to-open ranking experiments are obsolete in current builds. This closes [#195](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/195).
- MCP sessions now record real client identity and expose memory diagnostics in `codedb_status`. This closes [#37](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/37).
- Root policy now refuses to index the home directory itself, preventing the large MCP RAM spike reported in [#174](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/174).

### Performance And Memory

- Persisted warm-reopen state now covers startup-critical outline/state data and trigram sidecars, with lazy word-index rebuild and persistence on demand.
- Repeat snapshots in the same cache location skip redundant `word.index` rewrites instead of paying full rewrite cost every time.
- `mmap_overlay` now supports zero-heap incremental updates on top of mmap-backed indexes, and allocation-pressure fallback avoids false negatives by dropping to the safe full-scan path.
- `releaseContents` now uses `clearAndFree` so content-cache bucket arrays are actually released instead of being retained.
- MCP startup refuses exact home-directory roots, preventing pathological scans of `~` and the resulting multi-gigabyte memory spikes.

#### CLI Benchmarks (`ReleaseFast`, `openclaw`, current `main` vs `v0.2.54`)

| Benchmark | 0.2.55 | 0.2.54 | Delta |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| cold `tree` | `5.32s` | `5.29s` | `+0.6%` |
| `snapshot` | `6.53s` | `6.25s` | `+4.6%` |
| warm `tree` | `0.26s` | `6.16s` | `23.7x faster` |
| warm `search workspace` | `0.24s` | `6.14s` | `25.6x faster` |
| warm `word session` | `0.61s` | `5.99s` | `9.9x faster` |

Cold paths stay effectively flat, snapshot creation remains within the benchmark regression threshold, and warm reopen is dramatically faster.

#### MCP First Secondary-Project Call (`ReleaseFast`, `openclaw`)

| Tool | 0.2.55 | 0.2.54 | Delta |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `codedb_tree` | `0.076s` | `5.289s` | `69.6x faster` |
| `codedb_search` | `0.067s` | `5.278s` | `78.8x faster` |
| `codedb_word` | `0.285s` | `5.312s` | `18.6x faster` |

#### Peak RSS On `openclaw`

| Benchmark | 0.2.55 | 0.2.54 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| cold `tree` | `3478.8MB` | `3478.1MB` |
| warm `tree` | `192.6MB` | `3314.0MB` |
| warm `search` | `193.3MB` | `3312.9MB` |
| warm `word` | `677.1MB` | `3313.3MB` |

Warm RSS is materially lower because reopen no longer reconstructs the same large heap state on every process start.

#### Small-Corpus Sanity Pass (`codedb/src`)

| Benchmark | 0.2.55 | 0.2.54 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| cold `tree` | `0.045s` | `0.040s` |
| warm `tree` | `0.010s` | `0.030s` |
| warm `search` | `0.010s` | `0.030s` |
| warm `word` | `0.010s` | `0.030s` |

### Search, Ranking, And MCP

- Added `codedb_query`, a composable search pipeline for agent-driven retrieval workflows, including chained `find`, `search`, `filter`, `outline`, `read`, and `limit` stages in one call.
- `codedb_find` now retries delimiter-heavy queries more intelligently, truncates overly noisy per-file output, and skips more large generated directories by default.
- Historical query/open profiling is obsolete; current builds do not persist
  query records or include upload paths.
- `codedb_status` now reports client identity and index-memory diagnostics so MCP clients can see which kind of index is active and how much memory it is retaining.

### Distribution Reliability

- Historical remote installer and self-update notes were removed after codedb became source-build only.

### Parser And Correctness Fixes

- Fixed five correctness bugs from [#179](https://github.com/justrach/codedb/issues/179),
  including large-repo mmap cache validation, ANSI escape stripping,
  block-comment handling, and Python docstring detection.
- Parsing now correctly resumes after single-line `/* ... */` comments instead of skipping subsequent code on the line.
- Added regression coverage for the `#179` parser fixes so comment/docstring edge cases stay fixed.
